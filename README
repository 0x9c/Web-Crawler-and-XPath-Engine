5.3 Channel Subscriptions

Any special instructions for building and running your solution?
  (include detailed instructions, or write 'None')
1. The database path for crawling is set to "/tmp/database/dtianx";
2. Just followed the instruction in Piazza to set "ant servlet" path into "/usr/share/jetty/webapps/", but basically I am only using jetty8 in my VM. Don't know if it's all good in jetty. If something goes wrong, please try jetty8 instead. Thank you and sorry for inconvenience.
3. The create pattern is a little different from Homework introduction, in which requires "/create/{name}?xpath={xpath-pattern}". I just added both channel name and xpath as query strings like "/create?ChannelName={name}&XPath={xpath-pattern}". Sorry for the inconvience but it's kind of make sense. Since /create is not a real page for users. The reason for doing this is I am using form in HTML, which generates standard redirect url like this. Thank you.
4. Seperate Tests are in seperate packages. Not all of them are in "RunAllTest". Sorry for the inconvenience.
